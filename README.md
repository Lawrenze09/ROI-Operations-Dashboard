# Automation for Intelligent Document Processing and Automated Customer Intelligence

This repository serves as the central hub for tracking the financial impact of my AI automation projects. By integrating **Google Gemini AI**, **Make.com**, and **Notion**, I have quantified the exact ROI generated by automating complex business workflows.

## Portfolio Impact Summary (Total)
* **Total Transactions Processed:** 143 Records
* **Total Time Saved:** 17 Hours (1,021 Mins)
* **Financial Value Generated:** ₱1,871.55
* **System Efficiency:** Labor cost reduced based on a ₱695 daily rate (₱1.45/min).

## The ROI Formula
To ensure realistic business metrics, I implemented a unified formula in Notion:
`ROI = Value Created + (Time Saved * 1.45)`

* **Labor Rate:** ₱1.45/min (Based on ₱695/day budget).
* **Logic:** Combines the intrinsic value of AI output with direct labor savings.
